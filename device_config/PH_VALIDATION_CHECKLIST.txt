## Calibration Points Applied

| Sample | ADC | pH    | Buffer Type |
|--------|-----|-------|-------------|
| 1      | 166 | 4.01  | Acidic      |
| 2      | 434 | 6.86  | Neutral     |
| 3      | 539 | 9.18  | Basic       |

## Pre-Upload Verification

- [ ] PH_CALIB_COUNT = 3
- [ ] phCalibADC array: {166, 434, 539}
- [ ] phCalibPH array: {4.01, 6.86, 9.18}
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Firmware uploaded to Arduino

Time 30 min: pH = ___________

**Maximum Drift:** ___________ pH units
- [ ] PASS (<0.2 pH drift)  [ ] FAIL

---

## Expected Interpolated Values

These are theoretical values for validation:

| ADC | Expected pH | Calculation |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| 166 | 4.01        | Calibration point |
| 300 | ~5.43       | Between 166-434 |
| 434 | 6.86        | Calibration point |
| 490 | ~8.10       | Between 434-539 |
| 539 | 9.18        | Calibration point |

## Environmental Conditions

Temperature: ___________ °C
Buffer Temperature: ___________ °C
Probe Serial #: _________________
Probe Age: ___________ months
Last Cleaning: _________________

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Readings are consistently offset
→ Recalibrate with fresh buffer solutions
→ Check probe age (replace if >12 months)
→ Clean probe with pH cleaning solution

### Readings drift quickly
→ Probe may be drying out - store in buffer
→ Reference junction may be clogged
→ Check for air bubbles in probe tip

### Non-responsive or stuck readings
→ Check connection to pin A0
→ Verify probe cable is not damaged
→ Test with multimeter (should see voltage change)

### Readings outside 0-14 range
→ Check ADC reference voltage (should be 5V)
→ Verify probe is properly connected
→ May need to add boundary checks in code

## Final Approval

Overall Calibration Status:
- [ ] APPROVED - All tests passed
- [ ] CONDITIONAL - Minor adjustments needed
- [ ] FAILED - Recalibration required
